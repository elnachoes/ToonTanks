This is a udemy project that I am following along with. The game is functional 

I Spent some time learning how to import assets from the epic game store into a unreal project and also how to modify them in blender to work with the game. One asset I used has been ripped from an older video game but the normals were upside down so I had to use blender to flip all the normals on the model in order to have the textures render on the right side.
